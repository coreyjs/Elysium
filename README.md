# Elysium

Elysium is an application to help game developers, writers and others define/manage/map out 
narrative experiences.  This was built to help manage a growing number of storylines, characters for a personal game project.
This acts as a single source of truth for the game's narrative, which can be exported to JSON and imported into your engine
of choice.  For instance, I export into JSON and import into Unreal Engine 5's DataTable.  

Currently this is configured as such:
- Rails 7
- Ruby 3.2.2
- PostgresQL
